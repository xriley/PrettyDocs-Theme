                                <p>This section describes the functioning of the WPLMS system. WPLMS is a complex system which works on top of several functionalities which are provided by the plugins included in the theme.</p>

<!-- System

                                  <li><strong>User Registration</strong> : This section is managed completely by BuddyPress and WordPress. Any page which is connected to the WP Admin - settings - buddypress - pages - registration becomes the registration page. BuddyPress overwrites this page and the content in the page is not loaded. WPLMS only adds styling to the page including the section accordion. This page is not avaiable to logged in users (because they're already registered) and has two sections. The first one is required and asks for User name (login), password and email, the second one section is built using the fields set in the WP Admin -> Users -> User fields section.

                                  <li><strong>Activation</strong> : This section is managed completely by BuddyPress. Any page which is connected to the WP Admin - settings - buddypress - pages - Activate becomes the registration page. BuddyPress overwrites this page and the content in the page is not loaded This page is not avaiable to logged in users (because they're already registered) . Upon successful registration the user gets an email with an activation link, the link is of the format : http://yoursite.com/activation-page-slug/XXXYYY in this link the XXXYYY is the activation code.<br />
                                  When a user registers via BuddyPress it gets stored in the WP Signups table. The signups table also record the activation code. When a user activates his account by clicking on the activation link or entering the activation code in the activation page, it creates the user from the WP Signups table.

                                  <li><strong>Directory pages (All Members, All Activity, All Courses, All Groups)</strong> : All the directory pages are pages connected at the WP Admin - settings - BuddyPress - Pages section. Any page connected here is built using BuddyPress template files and none of the WordPress content will be shown.<br />
                                  For example : The course directory page is built using the wplms/course/index.php file. To overwrite this or build a new layout, you need to add the folder "course" in your child theme and add an index.php file which would overwrite the one in the parent WPLMS theme.

                                    <li><strong>Course Purchase</strong> : A course by default has no connection with the purchase process. The process of assignment starts after the course is purchased. In case of memberships, when a course is assigned to a membership level and a user who is subscribed to the membership level opens the course the course assignment starts.
                                    For example: If a course is connected to a woocommerce product, then when the purchase for the course is finished. The course assignment starts when the order has been marked as complete, which is on the hook "woocommerce_order_status_completed". At this point the expiry point for the user purchasing the course is set. The expiry point is calculated on the product subscription (if set) or on course duration. Which equals current timestamp + the course duration/subscription duration
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Course Subscription</strong> : When a user is subscribed to a course. Two User meta values for the user are set : courseID and course_status.courseID, courseID is numeric value of course. The value for usermeta field "courseID" is the expiry timestamp for the user. Whereas the course_stats.courseID has value of 1  which indicates course is ready to begin. A postmeta field is also set for the course with key as UserID and value as 0.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Course Start</strong> : When the subscribed user starts a course the Number of students in course counter increases. The course_status>courseID usermeta value is set to 2 which indicates the user has started the course. The course postmeta with key as userID is set to 1.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Course Statuses</strong> : Course status govern the display of the take this course button. <br />
                                    Course status : 1 : START COURSE<br />
                                    Course status : 2 : CONTINUE COURSE<br />
                                    Course status : 3 : FINISH COURSE : COURSE UNDER EVALUATION<br />
                                    Course status : 4 : COURSE EVALUATED</li>
                                    <li><strong>Course Submission</strong> : When course is submitted by the user the course_status.courseID user meta is set to 3</li>
                                    <li><strong>Course Evaluation</strong> : When course is submitted by the user the course_status.courseID user meta is set to 4</li>
                                    <li><strong>Badges</strong> : All badges are connected to courses and badge information is stored in course meta vibe_course_badge,vibe_course_badge_percentage,vibe_course_badge_title. The badges are stored in user meta field "badges" as a serialised array of course ids. This value is fetched in the user profile section to generate the badges for the course.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Certificates</strong> : All certificates are connected to courses and badge information is stored in course meta vibe_course_certificate,vibe_course_certificate_template,vibe_course_passing_percentage. The certificates are stored in user meta field "certificates" as a serialised array of course ids. This value is fetched in the user profile section to generate the certificates for the course.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Course Finish</strong> : When course is submitted by the user the course_status.courseID user meta is set to 4 and the postmeta field in the course is updated to marks obtained by the user in the course. These marks are shown in user results section.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Course Expiry</strong> : When a user is active in a course but the expiry time set for the user is less than the current timestamp. The course appears as expired for the user. The expiry time is stored in user meta field where the user key is the course id.</li>
                                </ul>
